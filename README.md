# Shield Bearer
My game for the js13kgames.com competition (2019)!  You play as a Shield Bearer with a Backscatter Buster and one objective: **SURVIVE!**  Use your Backscatter Buster to shoot down ~~the bad guys~~ all while using your shield to protect your _backside._  Careful, now!  The shots from the Backscatter Buster might come back to haunt you if you are unprepared!

## Objective
Control the Shield Bearer with your keyboard or touchscreen controls on mobile.  Position the Bearer's Shield to be in front of enemy fire, **the Shield will take the damage and keep the Bearer safe!**  If the Shield Bearer's back is turned toward the shot, **then the Bearer will take damage!**  Use the Bearer's Backscatter Buster to defeat the enemy!  Be careful, though, the shots from the Backscatter Buster can bounce off of the walls, come back, **and can damage the Bearer!**

## Controls
I've tried to emulate standard platformer controls into this game.
### Keyboard
The keyboard was set up for left or right handed movement, whichever the player preferred to use.
* A key or left arrow to move left
* D key or right arrow to move right
* W key or up arrow to jump
* S key or down arrow to drop from a platform
* Spacebar to fire the Backscatter Buster
### Touchscreen
When viewed on a phone, the touchscreen controls will appear.  If you do not want these controls to show up, tap the "hide" button at the top ~~side~~.  The controls default to left handed movement, but can be switched to right handed movement by tapping the "switch" button at the top ~~other side~~.
* Left arrow to move left
* Right arrow to move right
* Up arrow to jump
* Down arrow to drop from a platform
* Fire button to fire the Backscatter Buster
* Hide button to hide the touchscreen controls
* Switch button to switch what side the movement controls will appear on
### Joypad
No joypad or console controller support...yet.

## TODOs
A list of things I, as a Developer, should get done for this game!
### Critical
A list of things I got to get done, or I'm not going to have a game to upload for the competition!
* ~~An index.html file to run the game on!~~
* ~~An HTML5 Canvas or some other way to draw my characters!~~
* ~~A refresh rate to redraw that "canvas"~~
* ~~A moveable character with Keyboard controls!~~
* ~~Walls to keep that character on the screen!~~
* ~~A working Shield~~
* ~~A working Backscatter Buster~~
* Enemies to shoot!
* Enemies that die when shot!
* The Backscatter Buster shot is remove when it hits the enemy
* Enemy fire to avoid!
* ~~The Backscatter Buster's shot rebounds off of walls!~~
* The Backscatter Buster shot is remove when it hits the Shield
* The Backscatter Buster's shot can hurt the Bearer when rebounding!
* Bearer has **health**, lives, or something that gets lost when hurt!
* There is a score that is increasing when enemies are shot and destroyed!
* A game over screen!
### Not so Critical
My game won't be the complete vision that I was hoping it would be, but I could still potentially "ship" the game without them.
* Platforms for the Bearer to jump on
* A second enemy type
* Global high score table
* Touchscreen controls
* A "Start Game" Screen
* Increasing abilities for each enemy type
### Nice to Haves
These are things that would be nice to have in the game, if I have the time to make them within the competition.
* Awesome design for the Bearer, including Backscatter Buster
* Awesome design for the Bearer's Shield
* Awesome designs for the Enemy Types
* Cool looking projectiles
* A background
* A third or more Enemy Type(s)
* Joypad support, if even possible
